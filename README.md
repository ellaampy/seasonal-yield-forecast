**1.1 BRAZIL**

From Nóia Junior et al. (2021; 10.1088/1748-9326/ac26f3) - The occurrence of adverse climatic events between June and September are the main cause of wheat yield losses in Brazil.

 - **2006**: National yield dropped by 15% because dry conditions caused a delayed planting, which reduced the potential wheat yield. A combination of drought and hard frosts at the end of August and September further reduced wheat yields (1, 2).
 - **2015**: Yield losses in Santa Catarina and in some parts of Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná. El Nino caused excessive rainfall in the region, increasing the relative humidity. The high relative humidity caused foliar diseases and the sudden high demand in fungicide applications caused production costs to rise by 70% (4).
 - **2017**: The national yield dropped by 36% compared to previous year because of drought and frost conditions during critical development stages of the crop. The drought occurred in June, July, September and October and its effects were magnified by extremely high temperatures (3, 5, 6). 


**1.2 USA**

For the USA, the Great Plains is the heartland of winter wheat production (Zhao et al., 2022, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-34947-6).
