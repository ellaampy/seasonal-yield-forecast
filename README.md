### Crop calendar and study region

For the USA, the Great Plains, inlcuding South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas is the heartland of winter wheat production (10). Great plains states are highlighted with a blue border in the figure below.

### Annual state-level yield and trend

Yield trend in the great plains from 2002-2022 is neglectable. Annual yield data is not detrended, we train a model to estimate absolute yield instead of yield anomalies.
